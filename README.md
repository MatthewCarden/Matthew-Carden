# Assignment P1: First GUI Development Project

**Matthew Carden**

The development tools I used were:
* MacBook Pro
* Python
* Tkinter

I only encountered one issue while developing, and that
was a centering problem with the buttons in the window.
I eventually figured out the problem was due to the 
size of the window.
